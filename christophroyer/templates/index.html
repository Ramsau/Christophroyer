            I'm a self-taught programmer with a focus on individually made websites for you and your business.<br>
            Whether you only want a small page to tell the online world that you exist, or you want your whole
            booking system online, including a personal phone app - or anywhere in between - I have you covered.<br>
            I will help you decide what solution is best for you and develop it according to your ideas.

            Nowadays, everything can - and is - copied from others, which is why it's important to me to
            keep improving, reiterating and reimagining. How would we stand out after all if everything has to look the same?<br>
            Because of this, I create each project with its own style and feel, to make it uniquely yours.

            I was born in 2001 and I come from Ramsau, Austria. Since autumn of 2020, I have been studying
            Computer Science at <a href="https://www.tugraz.at" target="_blank">TU Graz</a>.

            While studying
            at Highschool in Radstadt, I started taking an interest in software development. After my first year coding in
            <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/" target="_blank">C#</a>,
            and getting to know the principles of programming, I moved over to
            <a href="https://python.org" target="_blank">Python</a>, which is my main strength to this
            day. But through my various pet projects and university courses I do have a wider base of
            knowledge: from <a href="https://arduino.cc" target="_blank">Arduino</a>'s C to the "big three"
            of web development - JavaScript, Html and CSS - but also
            App development with <a href="https://flutter.dev" target="_blank">Flutter</a>, among bits and pieces
            from other frameworks.<br>
            In University, I have been learning a lot about the theoretical side of computer science, as well as
            getting hands-on experience in C, C++, SQL and Java.
