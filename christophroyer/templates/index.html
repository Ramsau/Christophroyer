        <h1>Hi, I'm Christoph.</h1>
        <p>I'm a self-taught programmer, making whatever comes to mind with whatever platform works best.<br>
            Tell the world about myself - make a website. Shoot nerf darts -
            make an autonomous turret with face recognition. Don't want to get up to turn off the lights - bolt a servo
            to the wall and make a phone app. Go wild.
        </p>
        <h3>Don't settle for the known.</h3>
        <p>In a digital world, everything can be copied exactly without effort, which is why it's important to me to
            keep improving, reiterating and reimagining. How would we stand out after all if all we do is copy others?<br>
            Because of this, each of my projects is built individually for its purpose - giving it its own character and feel.
        </p>
