            I would love to hear your project ideas or software requests - the more exotic, the better.
            Whether it's about a piece of software or website I can design for your business or a novel idea we can
            take co-ownership of - Let's see what we can do together!
        </p>
        <p>
            After you write to me, we can get together personally to work out a concept or write via E-mail - of course free of
            charge and without commitment. I provide quick, personal feedback when it comes to requests, questions or errors in my work -
            not the impersonal, slow-moving customer service known from big companies. So get in touch, I'm looking
            forward to hearing from you!
        </p>
