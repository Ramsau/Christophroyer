"        <p>I'm a self-taught programmer, making whatever comes to mind with "
"whatever platform works best.<br>\n"
"            Tell the world about myself - make a website. Shoot nerf darts "
"-\n"
"            make an autonomous turret with face recognition. Don't want to "
"get up to turn off the lights - bolt a servo\n"
"            to the wall and make a phone app. Go wild.\n"

"        <p>In a digital world, everything can be copied exactly without "
"effort, which is why it's important to me to\n"
"            keep improving, reiterating and reimagining. How would we stand "
"out after all if all we do is copy others?<br>\n"
"            Because of this, each of my projects is built individually for "
"its purpose - giving it its own character and feel.\n"

"completing my civil service as a paramedic\n"
"        in Schladming, while taking freelance work as a programmer in my "
"free time. After this time, I will enroll\n"
"        at university for a formal IT/computer science education.</p>\n"
"        <p>While studying at Highschool in Radstadt, I started to teach "
"myself how to code. After my first year coding in\n"
"        C#,and getting to know the principles of programming, I moved over "
"to Python, which is my main strength until this\n"
"        day. But through my various projects involving many different "
"environments I do have a wider base of\n"
"        knowledge: from Arduino's C to the \"big three\" of web development "
"- JavaScript, Html and CSS - and even a bit of\n"
